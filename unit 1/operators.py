# Assignment Operators- Exclusively used to 
# assign values to variables.
# Think key / value pairings

# we use a single equal sign to represent the assignment
# operator.
name = 'beltran'
grade = 10
school = True

# Arithmetic Operators- Used on numerical
# data types to perform calculations.
#intergers (whole numbers) and floats ( decimal numbers)

# print is a funcion that lets us show code
# in the terminal.
print(3 + 3)# additional operator
print(3.9 - 3) # addition operator
print(12 / 3) # division operator
print(3 * 3) # multiplication operator

# Comparison Operators- Set of symbols used
# to assess if data is the same or different and
# how they differ.

print(10 > 1) # greater than operator
print(10 < 2) # less than operator

# 2 equal signs compare is something is the same
print("jordan" == "Jordan") # same as (false)
print("2" == 2) # same as (false)
print(2.0 == 2) # same as (true)

# not equal is written with !=
# this is to check and filter for values that are not
# the same
print(200 != 100) # true- these are not the same
print(300 != 300) # false- these are the same

# logical operators- compares 2 conditions to check if
# they are true or false
# conditions = other operators
# instead of symbols, we represent these with words:
# and, or , not

# AND - checks if 2 conditions are ture. if yes, the final
# result is true
print(3 > 1 and 100 < 50) # this would come out to be true

# OR - checks if only one condition is true. if yes,
# the final result will be true
print(3 > 1 or 100 < 50)

# NOT - the "opposite day" operator. it will reverse the
# result of the logical operators
print(not(3 > 1 and 100 < 50)) 
# this would come out to be false
